:::tip Use the Google Maps plugin instead
As of February 2021, the Smart Map plugin has been replaced by the [Google Maps plugin for Craft CMS](https://plugins.craftcms.com/google-maps).
:::

After evolving as Smart Map for seven years, this plugin has been renamed to **Google Maps**. It has been completely, 100% refactored from the ground up, improving upon every single aspect of the original plugin.

The new Google Maps plugin is _better_, _faster_, and _easier to use_. It does everything that Smart Map did and much, much more! And it's backed by [detailed documentation](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/google-maps/) which explains every single feature in depth.
