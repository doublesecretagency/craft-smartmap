Smart Map gives you a powerful "Address" field which allows you to...

- Do [proximity searches](/sorting-entries-by-closest-locations/) (aka "store locator")
- Create [dynamic & static maps](/render-a-map-in-twig/)
- [Geolocate](/visitor-geolocation/) site visitors
- Customize a map in [Twig](/customizing-the-map-in-twig/)
- Manipulate a map in [JavaScript](/manipulating-the-map-in-javascript/)
- Format a map with [custom styles](/styling-a-map/)
- Add [info window bubbles](/adding-marker-info-bubbles/)
- Use [KML files](/kml-files/)
- Fully [translatable](/internationalization-support/)
- Partial GraphQL support

Once you have installed the Smart Map plugin, simply **create a new field using the "Address (Smart Map)" field type**, and add it to a section. You'll see the magic once you start editing entries in that section!
